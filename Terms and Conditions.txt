True Cleaning Solutions - Terms & Conditions

Hi there! We're so grateful to have worked with many of you for the past few years. These Terms & Conditions are here to ensure everything is crystal clear and fair for both you and us at True Cleaning Solutions. We promise there's no fine print or sneaky clauses — just honest info about how we work together.

1. Who We Are
We’re True Cleaning Solutions, your local and friendly cleaning company based in Milton Keynes. When we say "we", "our" or "us", that’s who we mean. When we say "you", we’re talking about our lovely client (that’s you!).

2. Booking a Clean
Once you confirm your booking with us (by text, email, phone or our website), it means you’re happy with what we've agreed and you accept these terms. If anything changes, just give us a shout — we’re always happy to chat.

3. What You Can Expect from Us

We show up on time and ready to clean.

We can use our own products and equipment, or yours if you prefer — just let us know what works best for you.

Every cleaner we send is thoroughly vetted, trained, and verified by us to ensure you receive a high standard of service.

We'll do our absolute best to send you the same cleaner(s) each time.

If your regular cleaner is unwell or on holiday, we’ll try to let you know in advance and send someone equally fab.

4. What We Ask of You

Please make sure we have access to your home at the agreed time (key/code/etc.).

Let us know if there’s anything delicate or valuable that needs special care.

If we need a parking permit or space, please let us know.

If you'd like us to focus on anything specific during a visit, just drop us a message before the clean.

5. Payment

We’ll send you an invoice after each clean

Payments are due within 7 days by bank transfer unless we agree otherwise.

If you're having any issues with payment, please talk to us — we’re understanding and flexible.

6. Cancellations & Changes

Need to reschedule or cancel? No problem! Just give us at least 24 hours' notice.

For last-minute cancellations (less than 24 hours), we may need to charge 50% of the agreed fee, unless it's an emergency.

If we ever need to cancel, we’ll do our best to give you plenty of notice.

7. If Something's Not Right
We truly care about the work we do. If you’re ever not 100% happy, let us know within 24 hours and we’ll come back to make it right. That’s our promise to you.

8. Accidents Happen
We're fully insured and super careful, but in the rare case something gets damaged during a clean, please let us know within 24 hours. We’ll handle it fairly and quickly.

9. Keeping Things Safe
We follow all health & safety guidelines, and we treat your home with respect. If there’s ever anything you’re concerned about, please get in touch.

10. Personal Info
We only use your contact details to manage your cleaning service. We don’t share your information with anyone else — ever.

11. Working With Our Team
We kindly ask that you don’t hire our cleaners directly while working with us and for 6 months afterward. It helps us keep our team secure and happy. It takes a lot of time, energy and care to train a cleaner to our standards, and it's not fair to lose someone we've invested in. If you do decide to hire one of our cleaners directly, there may be a referral fee.

12. Wrapping Up Our Services
Want to pause or stop your service? No worries. Just give us a minimum of 30 days' notice and we’ll update your schedule.

13. Legal Bits
These terms follow UK law, and any disputes would be settled by a UK court. But hopefully, it never comes to that — we believe in sorting things with a good old-fashioned conversation first.

Thanks again for choosing us.
We appreciate your trust and loyalty more than we can say. If you have any questions about these terms or anything else, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Warmest regards,The True Cleaning Solutions Team
